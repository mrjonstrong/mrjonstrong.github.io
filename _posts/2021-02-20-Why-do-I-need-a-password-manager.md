## Why do I need a password manager?

Because it actually makes your life easier. It is quicker to log into a website or app using a password manager autofill than typing your password, or more likely hitting the password reset link.

Easy to share wifi passwords with friends.

Reduces the risk of you entering the password into a fake site. For instance if you get an email about a tax refund and click the link to the tax website, your password manger will not autofill the password if it is not the right address.

Have you seen a friend post about a Raybands sale on Facebook? Followed by another saying they were 'hacked'? Or had an email from a friend asking for money out of the blue, followed by another saying they were 'hacked'? These hacks are likely because your friend used the same or similar passwords on multiple sites. When one site has a breach, your email address and password is shared with the world. Someone will take your email address and password and try it on every site on the internet.

There is no way to remember all your passwords yourself. I have around 300 items stored in my password manager. Most people I have spoken to have at least 50 or more. Although the only stat I could find was from [McAfee in 2018](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/security-world-password-day/) saying the average was 23. That is still more than I could remember.

But what if I use a different password for each site now? The chances are it is similar and easy to guess the variations.

Are your passwords strong? If you can remember multiple ones the chances are they are not. Remeber the hackers know most people substitute an 'a' for @ or a 'o' for a 0 etc.

Most people use date of births or other significant dates. Names of children, partners, pets etc.
