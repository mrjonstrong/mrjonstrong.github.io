## History of passwords

Since the Roman's people have used passwords to authenticate peaople. Back then it was to establish friend from foe.

But then the first use of a password was from the early 1960's at MIT. The computer was a shared resource with users allocated 4 hours a week. So a password was used to authenticate the users and also allowed them keep their own files private.

More recently I remember a time in the early days of the world wide web (1990s) when you just used the same simple password everywhere. I don't remember having that many sites or places to enter a password either. Maybe it was a little bit more complex and possibly even adapted over time.

## Passwords now

Acording to some research a few years ago the average person had around 100 passwords (or at least places that needed passwords). I guess most will be websites and/or applications. I know at last check I had over 300. Most sites in the early days probably didn't have much if any password requirements, now most sites do have stricter requirements.

## Why should we care about passwords?

Many people think they have nothing to loose, and nobody would be interested in 'hacking' them. But how many of us have seen family or friends saying they have had their social media or email accounts comprimised?

Criminals try and compromise emails and social media accounts of anyone they can. They can then use these to compromise others or try and get money from family and friends whilst they impersonate you.

## How could someone break into my account?

Some of the most common methods to compromise your account:

1. An attacker has access a list of passwords from a site and take your credentials and tries them on other sites. Perhaps even with some veriation.
2. An attacker takes a list of commonely used passwords and tries to log into your account by trying each of them.
3. An attaker tricks you into clicking a link that takes you to a fake site. Often pretending to be a major social media site or email. It then asks you to sign in and captures your credentials. This can be automated to even try and log in with your details and ask for any 2FA codes.

## How can I avoid getting hacked?

As one of the most common ways of account copmrimse is due to password reuse. Use a unique password for each site.
