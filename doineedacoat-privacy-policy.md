## Privacy Policy

Last updated: 21 August, 2025

Do I Need A Coat is designed with privacy in mind. This app helps you decide what to wear for your run based on weather conditions and your personal comfort preferences.

Information We Collect
	•	Location Data: If you allow location access, Do I Need A Coat will use your device’s location to fetch local weather information. Your location data is only used on your device for the purpose of getting the weather and is not stored or shared.
	•	Usage Data: The app stores your clothing comfort feedback locally on your device to improve recommendations. This data never leaves your device.

How We Use Information
	•	To provide accurate weather-based clothing suggestions.
	•	To personalize recommendations based on your past feedback.

What We Don’t Do
	•	We do not track you.
	•	We do not sell your data.
	•	We do not share your data with third parties.
	•	We do not use third-party analytics or advertising trackers.

Third-Party Services

Do I Need A Coat may use external weather data providers (e.g., Open-Meteo, WeatherKit) to retrieve weather forecasts. Only the minimum necessary information (such as your approximate location coordinates) is sent to these services to get weather data.

Your Choices
	•	You can disable location access in your device settings.
	•	You can delete the app at any time to remove all locally stored data.

Changes

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant changes will be noted in the app or on this page.
